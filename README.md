## Overview

Welcome to the **Precise Environmental Procedural Simulator Extraordinaire**â€”
a highly detailed, reality-faithful environment that mimics real-world dynamics 
such as the day-night cycle, weather patterns, and basic interaction mechanisms.
Designed as a modular platform, the simulator serves as a foundation for various game types,
 including survival games, platformers, and construction-based environments.

The simulation leverages object-oriented design,
with complex object creation and strategies distributed across multiple files and methods for maintainability and extensibility.
It also utilizes lambda expressions, method references, and callbacks to efficiently manage events and interactions within the simulation.
